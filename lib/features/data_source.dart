You were not only a great instructor who explained the course with clarity,  but also a true mentor who shared life lessons that touched me deeply. Your respectful character and the values you always reflect—patience, ethics,
   and perseverance—made a real difference in my perspective.
 ✨Personally, I used to focus only on the final result, but through your advice and stories I learned to be patient with myself, to trust the process, and to believe that not all great outcomes appear immediately. This lesson is something I will carry with me beyond the classroom.🌸I truly appreciate the time, effort, and sincerity you put into teaching us. I wish you continuous success, happiness, and blessings in your life.""",screenColor: ColorPallete.def)
