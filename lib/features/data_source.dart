When I first joined NTI, I didn’t expect to gain much in terms of knowledge and learning. But Alhamdulillah, Allah blessed me with meeting you, and I benefited from you greatly — scientifically, morally, and ethically. May Allah bless you and grant you success, Insha’Allah.

And if the only thing I took away from NTI was meeting a beautiful and delightful soul like yours, that alone would be more than enough for me. Thank you so much, and may Allah grant you success in all that lies ahead.

    This is the least thing we can do to express our thanks and gratitude to you.

I am truly very grateful for everything you did with us throughout the training period.
Your effort, patience, and care to deliver the information to us in a simple and clear way made a big difference for us, and also made the experience very enjoyable and beneficial.
You were not only transferring knowledge to us, but you were also always encouraging us to love the field and continue in it.

Really Your advices made a big difference to me.

May God bless you, your life, and your efforts, increase you from His grace and bounty, and always make you a reason for spreading knowledge to others

I didn’t only benefit from you technically and understood Flutter in a clear and practical way, but I also learned how to face challenges and search for solutions by myself.

I also learned from you in a religious and personal way. Your words and advice gave us positive energy and made every session light, enjoyable, and full of benefit.

We really appreciate all your attempts to make the information simple and clear, and for always checking that we truly understood. This shows your sincerity and care for us.

Your patience, encouragement, and style of teaching made us believe that we can achieve our dreams. That is something I will never forget.
